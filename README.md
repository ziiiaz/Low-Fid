> ## Summary and the purpose of the project
> The Department of Homeland Security provides an option to file a complaint if travelers were experiencing unusual and/or repetitive security screening, denied or delayed entry into or exit from the U.S. at the port of entry or border crossing. After conducting Heuristic Evaluation, two interviews, and recently working on two scenarios, now this project is seeking to remove the obstacle of checking the status of a complaint. In the second interview, we find out why someone might not file a complaint due to the lack of information about previous cases and how serious DHS is in resolving these issues. For example, while DHS published TSAâ€™s program failure and the screening device error, it is not accessible for everyone, especially those who visit the file a complaint page.  In the last part of the project, we find out that the target struggles with the website, and it is not easy for her to figure out how to check the status of her complaint. Therefore, we made several minimalistic modifications to the website and specifically changed the complaint/redress status check page. In our low fidelity prototype, we considered almost all moves of the How Can I?  page. Due to the limitation, we restricted the actions only to this page. We ended up with 30 frames, resulting in either task completion (seeing the status) or error (incorrect code). We designed a back button that directs the user to the tracking page. We designed a dropdown tab that gives the user instructions to find or retrieve their code in case of an error. 


> ## List of tasks

>2.	Find and choose the How Can I? page
>3.	Find and choose the For Travelers â€“ either the picture or the text
>4.	Find and choose File complaint â€“ either the picture or the text
>5.	Choose from the three dropdowns tab
>6.	Find Track Your Redress Online
>7.	Complete the complaint status
>8.	In case of forgetting the code, follow the instruction, find or retrieve the code.

> ## Tester's walkthrough
> Out of 30 frames designed for this project, the tester skipped ten. Most of them were the possible interactions that we predicted and considered in the design. We introduced the website and what does this website expects to do. We told her how to show us her actions by using the (digital) pen. Since the recording was not possible due to the testerâ€™s request, we took notes of her pauses and interpreted them as hesitancy and confusion dues to the arrangement of the frames. 
The tester missed the first frame, which was the home page. She quickly circled the menu button and deliberately chose one of the similar frames (4th and 5th from the top left row). We interpreted this action as her understanding of the same result from choosing either the fourth or fifth frame. She went to TIPS, skipped WHAR TOU NEED TO KNOW, and found START FROM HERE. It seems this point was crucial for her since she skipped six other frames and moved to the third row from the top where REDRESS CONTROL NUMBER was shown under the START FROM HERE. We believe she found out that the other frames, mostly located in the middle left of the PDF, are unnecessary for her to reach the last two rows (below the page). Later she confirmed our assumption: she realized that she does not need to go through all the frames. In the end, she followed the design and frames sequentially, except for the bottom left frame, which she missed. To complete the task, she wrote down a code and considered both error and success. While the tester finalized the task and even tried to find a solution for the error, apparently, the arrangement of frames negatively affected her decision-making and the amount of time she needed to accomplish the tasks.
